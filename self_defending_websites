#methods
powershell
webshell
sql inj
cmd inj
file upload

#Standard Web Protection
web app firewalls
manual/staitc/dynamic code analysis
ids/ips
training / s-sdlc
logging and monitoring

> standard protection doesnt detect logic imperfection than can be exploited

#web app firewall
rule based
race conditions / false pos
use scoring model
doesnt know app
expensive
should be used as part of layered approach
sim issues with ids/ips

#code analysis
not good at detecting logic errors
complex apps hard to scan completely
having robust sdlc is important

#static scanning
analyzes raw source code
used for quality analysos
can have a lot of false pos
very detailed

#log and moitor
when you see it, it may be too late

>attack baiting and detection

#immediate detection should be followed by immediate action
detection of sql inj
system commands
javascript terms
/etc/passwd calls

#baiting
use dummy variables
send a cookie that shouldnt be used by app, if it comes back modified
dummy url strings come back changed

#geo-fencing
same user id across multiple IPs w/ diff subnets
simultaneous sessions or sessions over mult days

#blacklisting
modify the .htaccess file to deny certain ip

#create a firewall rule blacklist (long term)
deny ip or subnet after detection (proxy detection important)
4 hours first time then permanent after second attempt

#change param on every page view
have values changed on every page load
mapping random vars to every param

#annoyance
message boxes that only bots would click on
get significant delay on normally not accessed page
dynamic content page placement
redirect to massive file download

#benefits
no reliance on signatures
quick t implement
powerful and flexible
reuse through code library
layered defense
know how it is supposed to operate, which should be easy to find inconsistencies

swatch monitoring - watches logs for patterns

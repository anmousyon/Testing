cpu idles while waiting on memory

caching
    stores data that we think well need soon
    copied from slower to faster storage temp

fast storage checked
    if not there
        data copied to cache and used there
    else
        information used from cache

multi-core problem
    each processor has its own cache
        level one cache
    if p1 changes it cache
        others have older version & dont know
    if multiple proc have a copy of same data
        change not propogated throughout the caches

solution
    if one proc changes data
        invalidate other caches that have that data

safety - primary
    ensure bad things dont happen

liveness - secondary
    get good things to happen

direct memory access structure
    one interrupt per block rather than one per byte
    device controller transers blocks
        from buffer to main without cpu intervention

polling
    cpu checks if all the data has been moved to ram

notification
    after one block have ram send an interrupt
        then cpu processes interrupt
    stops cpu from polling after every byte
